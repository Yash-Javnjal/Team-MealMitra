## 📖 Introduction

Extra-To-Essential is a real-time resource redistribution platform that bridges the gap between surplus and need. The platform connects donors with verified NGOs through an intelligent geolocation-based matching system, ensuring that essential resources like food, clothing, and other necessities reach those who need them most.

Built with modern web technologies, the platform provides real-time tracking, live notifications, multi-language support, and role-based dashboards to create an efficient ecosystem for resource redistribution.

## 💡 Core Concept

**Surplus resources should not be wasted when they can help someone in need.**

Extra-To-Essential eliminates the logistical disconnect between donors and NGOs by providing:
- Real-time donation listing and tracking
- Geolocation-based matching of donors with nearby NGOs
- Volunteer coordination for pickup and delivery
- Live status updates and notifications
- Impact metrics and carbon credit tracking
